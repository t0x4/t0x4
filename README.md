# Hi there, I'm [toxa](https://t.me/t0x_aa)
### Offensive Security Enthusiast | CTF Player | Junior Pentester
# 🚀 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast deeply focused on Information Security, especially the offensive side.
Most of my time is dedicated to `CTF` challenges, vulnerability research, and hands-on practice in real-world–like lab environments.

---

I actively train on platforms such as PortSwigger Web Security Academy, Hack The Box, and TryHackMe, where I improve my skills in identifying, exploiting, and understanding security flaws in modern systems.
My primary interest lies in breaking systems, not building them — understanding how attackers think, how mistakes are made, and how defenses can be bypassed. I enjoy digging into vulnerabilities, analyzing misconfigurations, and chaining multiple weaknesses into full exploitation paths.

# 🔥 Offensive Security & CTF

Web application vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10 and beyond)  

API security testing and logic flaws  

Authentication & authorization bypasses  

Misconfigurations and insecure defaults  

Realistic attack chains and privilege escalation  
# 🎯 Capture The Flag (CTF)

Actively solving Web, API, and Network challenges

Writing detailed CTF writeups to document methodology and thought process

Focus on understanding why an exploit works, not just getting the flag

# 🕵️ Human Factor & Social Engineering

Studying how human behavior impacts security

Understanding phishing techniques and trust exploitation

Learning how psychological manipulation can bypass technical controls

# 🧰 Tools & Techniques

Security Tools I Actively Use:

Burp Suite (manual testing, logic bugs, bypasses)

Nmap (reconnaissance & service discovery)

Metasploit (post-exploitation & testing)

Wireshark (traffic analysis)

SQLMap (validation & learning automation limits)

Netcat (pivoting, shells, testing)

I focus heavily on manual analysis rather than blind automation — tools are used to assist thinking, not replace it.

# 📚 Learning Philosophy

I believe strong security skills come from:

Deep understanding of attack surfaces

Hands-on practice over theory

Breaking things in controlled environments

Learning from mistakes and failed exploits

CTFs are not just competitions for me — they are a training ground for real-world security thinking.
